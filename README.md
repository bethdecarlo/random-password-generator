# Random Password Generator 

## Description

⚡️ Welcome to the repository for the Random Password Generator. This random password generator creates random passwords based on criteria selected by our user, an employee with access to sensitive data.  

⚡️ For example, the user can choose the length of the password, the and which character types will be used. Once the user selects their options, a random password is generated based on those parameters. If the user does not select choices within the parameters they are prompted with, they will be guided to try again with an alert that will remind them of the parameters.  

⚡️ The app will run in the browser and will feature HTML, CSS, and will be powered by JavaScript. I hope that you enjoy this application.
